## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously, especially since it interacts with physical hardware (Inverters/Batteries).

If you discover a security vulnerability (e.g., potential for unauthorized control via MQTT, injection flaws), please **DO NOT** open a public issue.

Instead, please report it privately:

1. Email us at **info@burger-home.com**.
2. Provide details on how to reproduce the vulnerability.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and work on a fix.
